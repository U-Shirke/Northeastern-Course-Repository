Project Description: 

The goal of this project is to create a database containing all relevant resources. The resources database will include: 

Programs offered on the Boston campus of Northeastern University in the College of Engineering, and details about their duration, offerings, and specializations. 
The relevant study material (paid and free resources) for all courses offered by COE. 
Tools and software required by the courses.  
Program contacts (Professors/Advisors/Current Teaching Assistants). 
Future career outcomes post-degree completion. 

We aspire to help learners through our initiative by helping them collate the resources they need to navigate their course. 

Strategy:

We are planning to web scrape the NEUâ€™s website and other educational platforms extensively to gather data. 
We would research and conduct surveys to collate the best fit for our database. 
We would be then using the above information to create the resources database for any particular course offerings. 

Outcome:

A consolidated resource repository as a database that is publicly available on GitHub. This will include documentation on how to use the database and a detailed walkthrough by the end of the project.
